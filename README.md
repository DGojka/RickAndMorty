#Rick and morty

The application displays a list of characters from the TV series that can be filtered by name or filters (favorite characters, alive, dead).
If both the "alive" and "dead" filters are selected, characters with the "unknown" status are displayed.

If you click on the character, more details about him are showed

The initial list only contains one page of characters from the API to prevent long loading times.
When the user scrolls to the bottom of the list, additional characters are automatically loaded.
